## SCRIPTING FEATURES ##

- Added MonoBehaviour environment.

- Added ScriptComponent (editor interactability work in progress).

- Added Engine Binds to translate between Cpp and C# functions.

- Added C# translations for GameObject, TransformComponent, MeshRendererComponent and CameraComponent.

- Added a simple example to portray ScriptComponent functionalities.

## PROBLEMS TO SOLVE ##

- Some core functionalities need to either be implemented or changed.

- Creating new C# Components is a tedius procedure.

- Interactability via the editor is not finished.

- Many improvements for user experience should be performed.

- Scripts work always, including when not in play mode.
