## SKELETAL ANIMATION CONTROLS ##

- Click add component on a gameobject to add skeletal animation source in the inspector
- It should open a window to control the skeleton of the .fbx (not working)


## FEATURES ##

- New revamped dockable UI look

- Scene and Camera serialization

- Asset/Library folder to visualise custom file formats

- Model Importer (problems in texture coordinates)

- Parenting and object creation within hierarchy and menu bar

- GameObject components: Camera, Light, MeshRenderer, Transform

- BoundinBoxes, MousePicking, Frustum Culling

- Shader Module (work in progress - almost finished)

- Octree (work in progress - implemented but not functional)

## SKELETAL ANIMATION FEATURES ##

- Skeletal animation window should be displayed

## SKELETAL ANIMATION ISSUES ##

- Tried to achieve what it was required but it doesn't import correctly the GameObject or the animation

- It gets laggy when pressing the Skeletal Animation Component when clicking Add Component in the inspector UI (code is commented in order to not affect the rest of the engine)

- Needs to be modified to work as expected (we will keep working on it)
